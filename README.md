**Maybe it's a beginning of a nice story...**

Hi there! 

Well... I think at first I should introduce myself. My name is Didar. I'm a student at 42 Heilbronn. 
I've recently joined the school and started to learn coding here from scratch.
I've joined here without any expirience in coding, so it feels a bit hard curenty, but it's so interesting to learn and discover this beautifull field.

Here I'll share you my projects and how it was done by me. So you might see some progress with the next projects. (I really hope it'll be there! :D)


P.S. Here's our "tree" of projects in case you really interested!

I hope it's somehow helps you and I wish you a beautiful day!
Cheers!
